propyl alchohol destroys polycarbonate plastics and filmms

methyl alchohol destroys ABS plastics and films : is polycarbonate film elastic

sent two to pig, and one broke. pig study was good data, then went bad. pig people gave singular ppg waveform so it was useless bc spO2 was needed.
btw in the interest of good communication, here's everything im working on and an approximate time frame:

projects:vibration table using raspberry pi
	
	 soluble plastic film for easier recycling of chest e-tattoo.

to learn:

	raspberry pi interface
	C code
	python signal processing MIT BSC lab
	ML algorithms
	Embedded systems
	LHR application
	IEEE robotics application
	matlab
	fast fourier transform
	signal filtering and the different types of filter implementation like Butterworth, chevychev etc. And how to filter signals based 	on set frequencies

to talk to:
	
	talk to tiande for the ecg tattoo codebase. he comes in around 4:30pm.
	talk to jishnu for sneaking into embedded systems lab
	-> the chemicals lady in the soft bioelectronics lab for getting plastics, alchohols, and training on the fume hood.

meetings:
	team meeting - tuesday at 3pm
	group meeting - friday at 9am
	

to organize: 
	CAD/Eagle model of chest e-tattoo
	calendar
	github codebase
	research/notes of raspberry pi 

possible projects: 
	fully flexible ears
	higher wire density
	SpO2 on the chest
	moving from coin cell to lion battery 
	trimodal: PPG, SCG, ECG
	bimodal: SCG, ECG
	dual device: SCG+SCG, ECG
